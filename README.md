# Oystercard Challenge

Afternoon challenge on Week 4 at Makers, looking at OOD.

## Focus goals

**I write code that is easy to change**
> Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

**I can test-drive my code**
> Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

**I can build with objects**
> Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.
